# Portfolio 2025

## Getting Started

I feel like it is time to update my portfolio, plus I can alsways use the practice.

### React

**Helpful Resources:**

* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

I may or may not need a database, but starting off I will treat this project as if I will need a database and so I will create a react app inside a folder labeld frontend.

Inside the directory/repository I will creat my react app the traditonal way using terminal commands...

`npx create-react-app frontend`

 Once created, I will go into the frontend folder using the command...
 
 `cd frontend`
 
Then to open the app in a browser..

`npm start`
